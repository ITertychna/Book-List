        name: '"Margaret Thatcher: The autobiography"',
        author: 'Margaret Thatcher',
        description: 'Margaret Thatcher is the towering political figure of late-twentieth-century Great Britain. No other prime minister in modern times sought to change the British nation and its place in the world as radically as she did. Published in a single volume for the first time, Margaret Thatcher is the story of her remarkable life told in her own words--the definitive account of an extraordinary woman and consummate politician, bringing together her bestselling memoirs The Downing Street Years and The Path to Power. Writing candidly about her upbringing and early years and the formation of her character and values, she details the experiences that propelled her to the very top in a man`s world. She offers a riveting firsthand history of the major events, the crises and triumphs, during her eleven years as prime minister, including the Falklands War, the Brighton hotel bombing, the Westland affair, the final years of the Cold War, and her unprecedented three election victories. Thatcher`s judgments of the men and women she encountered during her time in power-from statesmen, premiers, and presidents to Cabinet colleagues-are astonishingly frank, and she recalls her dramatic final days in office with a gripping, hour-by-hour description from inside 10 Downing Street. Powerful, candid, and compelling, Margaret Thatcher stands as a testament to a great leader`s significant legacy.',

        name: '"Autobiography of the Queen"',
        author: 'Emma Tennant',
        description: 'Queen Elizabeth has gone AWOL from Balmoral, and no one can find her. Where has she gone and why? This winsome, if unlikely, account of the Queen`s disappearance recounts the monarch`s solo journey to the Caribbean island of St. Lucia to take possession of her recently purchased home in the idyllic-sounding Joli Estate. Here, after more than half a century on the throne, she will recall the years of her reign in peace and tranquility, in the guise of her new identity as Gloria Smith. But the house is no more than a muddy hole in the ground, and the Queen must punt. She is not used to asking for anything, carrying cash, fending for herself, introducing herself, or being ignored. The story of the sovereign`s sojourn in her former colony is a funny and touching account of the sometimes contentious and occasionally baffling friendship between Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth and a scruffy young St. Lucian, Austin Ford. How this radical change of life and circumstance affects the Queen-and how she is transformed as a result-make for a hilarious and moving tale, in which her need for her subjects proves to be as strong as their desire that she remain on her throne',
